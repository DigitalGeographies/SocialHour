## Digital Geographies Lightning Talks and Social Hour hosted by the proposed Digital Geographies Speciality Group of the AAG and Microsoft Research New England

The proposed Digital Geographies specialty group of the AAG would like to invite you to participate in a social hour hosted by Microsoft Research New England (MSRNE) during the upcoming annual meeting of the American Association of Geographers in Boston.

The proposed Digital Geographies Specialty Group supports scholarship and pedagogy that further understandings of myriad ways that digital objects and digital practices produce space, place, and spatial relations, seeking to coalesce a diverse community of scholars whose work centers the digital as object, subject and/or medium of geographical thought,analysis and/or praxis. As an expression of these goals, and to bring together our burgeoning community, we are inviting and encouraging your participation and attendance at our first event, generously hosted by Microsoft Social Research New England.

The event will be held on **April 6th from 6-8pm** at the _MSRNE building_ (1 Memorial Drive #1, Cambridge, MA; see map below) and will feature both lightning talks and a chance to meet and talk with other researchers engaged in the broad and growing realm of Digital Geographies. The event will be followed by a happy hour at _MeadHall_ starting at **8:30 p.m.**

Those who wish to simply attend, meet similarly interested researchers, and discuss exciting ideas, need only provide their name and email address. Those wishing to present a lightning talk must additionally provide their talk title and a brief abstract. Lightning talks will be limited to 5 minutes in length and must have exactly 5 slides.
